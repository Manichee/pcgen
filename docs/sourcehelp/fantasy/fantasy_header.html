<h1>Fantasy help files</h1>
<p class="indent1">The 3e and 35e gameModes represent the third
edition and the 3.5 edition of the fantasy role playing game
published by Wizards of the Coast. Our datasets are based on the
version of this game published under the Open Gaming License
commonly known as the <a href="srd_help.html">Standard Reference
Document or SRD</a>. The rules were recently revised and that
version is known as the <a href="rsrd_help.html">(Revised) Standard
reference Document or RSRD</a>. All of the datasets which appear in
the sources tab along with the SRD and RSRD are dependent on having
these loaded and will not function properly without them.</p>
